            the 1960s, and with subsequent revivals in both street fashion and on the catwalk. It is popular festival
            gear in the present day, also known as a "session hat".</p>

        <p>The Ushanka is a Russian fur hat with ear-covering flaps that can be tied up on the crown of the cap, or
            fastened at the chin to protect the ears, jaw, and lower chin from the cold. The dense fur also offers some
            protection against blunt impacts to the head. They are also traditionally worn in the Baltic region
            including Sweden, Finland, Norway and the whole eastern European region.</p>

        <p>A fedora is a hat with a soft brim and indented crown, and is typically creased lengthwise down the crown and
            "pinched" near the front on both sides. The term fedora was in use as early as 1891. Its popularity soared,
            and eventually it eclipsed the similar-looking homburg.</p>
